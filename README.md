## Overview

### Description

This app helps people who are learning CSS. It has several modules that are specifically designed to facilitate the process of learning CSS. Some of these modules include a palette of colors with details, snippets of CSS code, a color detection with camera and CSS cheat sheets.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Learning / Teaching / CSS
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Provides a bunch of helper tools to facilitate the learning of CSS. The most exciting feature is the color detection tool using the camera.
- **Market:** Although this app is targeted at people learning/using CSS, it is avaible to everyone on android.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much they use CSS and/or need to accurately detect or describe colors.
- **Scope:** We will start by having helpful and easy to use modules. This app could evolve into a community based system where users can ask questions and share useful CSS snippets.
